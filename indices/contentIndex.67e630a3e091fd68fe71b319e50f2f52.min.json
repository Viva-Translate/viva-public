{"/":{"title":"Complete Abstraction of the Language Barrier","content":"\n## Talent is equally distributed, opportunity is not.[^1]\n\nFrom the Tower of Babel to Star Trek’s universal translator, the world has dreamed about what life would look like without language barriers. With the advent of foundation models[^2] such as GPT-3, machine translation (MT) output has in many applications become indistinguishable from that of a human translator. MT has even been used to communicate in high-stakes situations such as legal and medical cases.[^3] For daily situations around the world, MT is ubiquitous - in 2020, Google Translate’s app had over 1 billion monthly active users, or roughly 15% of the world’s population.[^4] \n\nDespite these advancements, the most crucial use cases for MT are still yet to be unlocked. These use cases include:  \n\n-   Engineers and designers abroad get remote jobs regardless of their language abilities - therefore, they make more money and have access to professional growth opportunities. \n-   Companies can hire freelancers completely independent of their language abilities - and save money.\n-   People in developing countries can work remotely without leaving their country, family \u0026 friends in search of better opportunities.\n-   Adults aren’t required to learn another language in order to work across borders.[^5]\n\nThis is not solely due to language model quality. \n\nThis is due to lack of: (1) ease of use across many technology products,[^6] (2) context-aware translations for specific use cases, and (3) low-latency and high-accuracy spoken translation. Viva solves this through integrations, domain-specific data, and speech translation.   \n\nViva provides a translation ecosystem that encompasses all day-to-day pain points around collaborating with someone who speaks a different language. The ecosystem will include bidirectional text communication, document translation, webpage translation, video translation, and ultimately in-person translation. Translations are domain-specific and context-aware, so they are more accurate than general-use tools. \n\nThe first application of Viva’s ecosystem is to enable remote work across borders between English and Spanish. This route unlocks more financial capital for funneling additional resources into language translation. From there, Viva expands to additional use cases in personal, professional, and in-person realms. \n\nWe are talking about a world where people fully collaborate across languages, where access to opportunities is decoupled from the language you speak.\n\nImagine this world.\n\n- - -\n\nInterested?

However, this can be incredibly tedious if the majority of your day occurs in another language. Integrations are also difficult in practice because of the sheer number required; translation operates as a layer on top of all written, spoken, and read communications.","lastmodified":"2022-05-16T05:25:44.561900178Z","tags":null},"/notes/problem":{"title":"Introduction to Machine Translation and Remote Work","content":"\nHere is the current state of the world:\n1. 80% of the world is not English-literate but is tech-literate.\n2. There is a massive and growing shortage of 40 million skilled technology workers.\n3. NLP, including machine translation, has drastically improved in the past decade.\n\nLanguage barriers are a huge and oftentimes invisible barrier that causes talent loss. Viva allows people to exercise their highly-in-demand skills by breaking down language barriers using NLP. \n\n## 1. 80% of the world is not English-literate but is tech-literate\n80% of the global workforce does not speak English. \n\nTech literacy is growing at a much, much faster rate than English literacy. Assuming that tech literacy is defined as knowing how to use a smartphone, nearly 84% of the world is tech literate. This number increased by almost 50% from 2017 to 2022. \n\nThe reality is that nearly everyone is becoming a tech worker. There are approximately 250 million knowledge workers globally. While knowledge workers only make up 10% of the world’s workforce, they account for over 50% of GDP.\n\nEnglish will not stay the sole dominant language of the professional working world.\n\nIn fact, English has been the second most-common native tongue in the world since 1995, trailing only Chinese. By 2050, Chinese will continue its predominance, with Hindi and Arabic climbing past English, and Spanish nearly equal to it.\n\n## 2. Technology worker shortage\nParticularly, there is a massive developer shortage that is growing rapidly. By 2030, there will be a global shortage of more than 85 million tech workers, representing $8.5 trillion in lost annual revenue.\n\nWhat’s more, tech workers in developing countries are eager to get remote jobs abroad.\n\nTech workers in developing countries often get paid twice, sometimes 3-5 times as much, working for a company in the United States. Freelancer earning potential for specialized roles is much higher than a general role - software developers can earn up to $1,000 USD / hr. As a result of this, technology is one of the two top industries for new freelancers. \n\nRemote work is increasing at a rapid rate the world over, with 70% of the workforce predicted to work remotely a minimum of five days per month by 2025.\n\nWorking remotely for a foreign company is also not only for monetary gain. Working for a company in the States is also a tremendous learning opportunity. \n\n## 3. NLP has improved a lot\nThe origins of NLP actually originated from machine translation devising ways to decode German intelligence during WWII. At that time, they projected full cross-language fluency.\n\nWe are closer than ever. Since then, people have attempted statistical machine translation modeling. Systran was a major player coming out of France in the 1980s. \n\nAs Google rose to prominence in the 2000s, they also created Google Translate (GT). GT was meant less to be an independently monetized model but rather to support the global user of Google Search and other products, thereby collecting more ad revenue and data. GT started with statistical MT but as other Google teams, other tech companies, and universities started using neural networks GT made the switch to neural machine translation, thereby increasing accuracy. \n\nNow, the world sits on another advancement in both AI infrastructure and modeling - large language models such as GPT-3 and BERT. Language translation and NLP has drastically improved and workflows haven’t caught up yet. We see the rise of consumer NLP (i.e. Grammarly), and the concept of AIX (AI applied). How might we incorporate these advancements and apply them downstream to MT?\n\nThere is still massive room for improvement in MT. Recent focus has been on training multilingual models for low-resource languages like Cherokee. Viva takes a fundamentally different approach by focusing on a single language and a specific domain.\n\nThere are many other problems that can be fixed by using large language models applied in pre and post-processing steps to MT. See the next section to explore how we make translation more context and tone aware. \n\n(TODO: add citations)","lastmodified":"2022-05-16T05:25:44.561900178Z","tags":null}}
