## Complete Abstraction of the Language Barrier

Talent is equally distributed, opportunity is not.[^1]

From the Tower of Babel to Star Trek’s universal translator, the world has dreamed about what life would look like without language barriers. With the advent of foundation models[^2] such as GPT-3, machine translation (MT) output has in many applications become indistinguishable from that of a human translator. MT has even been used to communicate in high-stakes situations such as legal and medical cases.[^3] For daily situations around the world, MT is ubiquitous - in 2020, Google Translate’s app had over 1 billion monthly active users, or roughly 15% of the world’s population.[^4] 

Despite these advancements, the most crucial use cases for MT are still yet to be unlocked. These use cases include:  

-   Engineers and designers abroad get remote jobs regardless of their language abilities - therefore, they make more money and have access to professional growth opportunities. 
-   Companies can hire freelancers completely independent of their language abilities - and save money.
-   People in developing countries can work remotely without leaving their country, family & friends in search of better opportunities.
-   Adults aren’t required to learn another language in order to work across borders.[^5]

This is not solely due to language model quality. 

This is due to lack of: (1) ease of use across many technology products,[^6] (2) context-aware translations for specific use cases, and (3) low-latency and high-accuracy spoken translation. Viva solves this through integrations, domain-specific data, and speech translation.   

Viva provides a translation ecosystem that encompasses all day-to-day pain points around collaborating with someone who speaks a different language. The ecosystem will include bidirectional text communication, document translation, webpage translation, video translation, and ultimately in-person translation. Translations are domain-specific and context-aware, so they are more accurate than general-use tools. 

The first application of Viva’s ecosystem is to enable remote work across borders between English and Spanish. This route unlocks more financial capital for funneling additional resources into language translation. From there, Viva expands to additional use cases in personal, professional, and in-person realms. 

We are talking about a world where people fully collaborate across languages, where access to opportunities is decoupled from the language you speak.

Imagine this world.

[^6]: At first glance this may sound like a weak differentiator - why not just copy and paste from a dedicated translation app? However, this can be incredibly tedious if the majority of your day occurs in another language. Integrations are also difficult in practice because of the sheer number required; translation operates as a layer on top of all written, spoken, and read communications.
