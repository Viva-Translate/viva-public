title: "Introduction to Machine Translation and Remote Work"

Here is the current state of the world:
1. 80% of the world is not English-literate but is tech-literate.
2. There is a massive and growing shortage of 40 million skilled technology workers.
3. NLP, including machine translation, has drastically improved in the past decade.

Language barriers are a huge and oftentimes invisible barrier that causes talent loss. Viva allows people to exercise their highly-in-demand skills by breaking down language barriers using NLP. 

## 1. 80% of the world is not English-literate but is tech-literate
80% of the global workforce does not speak English. 

Tech literacy is growing at a much, much faster rate than English literacy. Assuming that tech literacy is defined as knowing how to use a smartphone, nearly 84% of the world is tech literate. This number increased by almost 50% from 2017 to 2022. 

The reality is that nearly everyone is becoming a tech worker. There are approximately 250 million knowledge workers globally. While knowledge workers only make up 10% of the world’s workforce, they account for over 50% of GDP.

English will not stay the sole dominant language of the professional working world.

In fact, English has been the second most-common native tongue in the world since 1995, trailing only Chinese. By 2050, Chinese will continue its predominance, with Hindi and Arabic climbing past English, and Spanish nearly equal to it.

## 2. Technology worker shortage
Particularly, there is a massive developer shortage that is growing rapidly. By 2030, there will be a global shortage of more than 85 million tech workers, representing $8.5 trillion in lost annual revenue.

What’s more, tech workers in developing countries are eager to get remote jobs abroad.

Tech workers in developing countries often get paid twice, sometimes 3-5 times as much, working for a company in the United States. Freelancer earning potential for specialized roles is much higher than a general role - software developers can earn up to $1,000 USD / hr. As a result of this, technology is one of the two top industries for new freelancers. 

Remote work is increasing at a rapid rate the world over, with 70% of the workforce predicted to work remotely a minimum of five days per month by 2025.

Working remotely for a foreign company is also not only for monetary gain. Working for a company in the States is also a tremendous learning opportunity. 

## 3. NLP has improved a lot
The origins of NLP actually originated from machine translation devising ways to decode German intelligence during WWII. At that time, they projected full cross-language fluency.

We are closer than ever. Since then, people have attempted statistical machine translation modeling. Systran was a major player coming out of France in the 1980s. 

As Google rose to prominence in the 2000s, they also created Google Translate (GT). GT was meant less to be an independently monetized model but rather to support the global user of Google Search and other products, thereby collecting more ad revenue and data. GT started with statistical MT but as other Google teams, other tech companies, and universities started using neural networks GT made the switch to neural machine translation, thereby increasing accuracy. 

Now, the world sits on another advancement in both AI infrastructure and modeling - large language models such as GPT-3 and BERT. Language translation and NLP has drastically improved and workflows haven’t caught up yet. We see the rise of consumer NLP (i.e. Grammarly), and the concept of AIX (AI applied). How might we incorporate these advancements and apply them downstream to MT?

There is still massive room for improvement in MT. Recent focus has been on training multilingual models for low-resource languages like Cherokee. Viva takes a fundamentally different approach by focusing on a single language and a specific domain.

There are many other problems that can be fixed by using large language models applied in pre and post-processing steps to MT. See the next section to explore how we make translation more context and tone aware.
